Cooking Instructions”

1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.

2. Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½""-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.

3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.

4. Add bread, apples, oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.
Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.

5. Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests. Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.

6. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.

7. Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.

8. Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside. Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half you should be able to smell the wine, about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.

9. Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.",

Master Chef: What a delicious-sounding dish! I'm excited to guide you through the preparation of Miso-Butter Roast Chicken With Acorn Squash Panzanella. Let's get started!

Step 1: Preparing the Chicken

First, we need to pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season it all over with 2 tsp. kosher salt. You can use your hands or a spatula to gently massage the salt into the meat.

Next, tie the legs together with kitchen twine. This will help keep the chicken compact during roasting.

Finally, let the chicken sit at room temperature for about an hour. This step is important as it allows the skin to dry slightly and helps the seasonings penetrate deeper into the meat.

As you're doing this, I want to emphasize the importance of using a sharp knife when patting the chicken dry. If the blade is dull, it can tear the skin instead of simply removing excess moisture.

How's that going? Do you have any questions about seasoning the chicken or tying the legs together?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trainee Chef: I'm excited to get started on this dish!

Okay, so I understand the importance of patting the chicken dry with paper towels and using a sharp knife to avoid tearing the skin. I'll make sure to use a sharp blade for that part.

Regarding seasoning the chicken, I do have a question - what exactly does it mean to "gently massage the salt into the meat"? Is there a specific technique or amount of pressure I should apply? I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly so the seasonings are evenly distributed.

Also, when tying the legs together with kitchen twine, how tight should the knot be? Should it be snug but not too tight that it's constricting the chicken?

Lastly, just to confirm - the chicken is going to sit at room temperature for 1 hour before we put it in the oven, right?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Master Chef: Excellent questions!

Massaging the salt into the meat

When I say "gently massage the salt into the meat," I mean using a gentle but firm touch to distribute the seasonings evenly. Think of it as giving the chicken a light, loving rubdown.

To do this:

 Hold the chicken firmly with one hand and use your other hand to gently press the salt into the meat.
 Use your fingertips to massage the salt into the skin, focusing on areas where the meat is thickest like the thighs and breast.
 Don't overdo it – a gentle touch will suffice. You're not trying to pound the chicken with salt!

Tying the legs together

When tying the legs together, aim for a snug but not too tight knot. Think of it as securing the legs in place without constricting the chicken's movement.

 Wrap the kitchen twine around the legs about 1-2 inches from the joint.
 Tie a gentle knot that won't cut off circulation or cause discomfort to the chicken.
 Make sure the knot is secure but not so tight that it compresses the meat.

Room temperature preparation

Yes, you're correct! The chicken will sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before we roast it in the oven. This step helps the seasonings penetrate deeper into the meat and promotes even cooking.

Now that we've got these details covered, let's move on to preparing the acorn squash!

Step 2: Preparing the Acorn Squash

You'll need to halve the squash and scoop out the seeds. Then, run a vegetable peeler along the ridges of each half to remove the skin.

Next, cut each squash half into ½-inch-thick wedges. Arrange these on a rimmed baking sheet for roasting later.

How's that going? Do you have any questions about preparing the acorn squash or would you like me to guide you through the next steps?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trainee Chef: Thank you so much for explaining and clarifying those steps! I feel more confident now in seasoning the chicken and tying its legs together.

Regarding the acorn squash, I do have a question - what kind of vegetable peeler should I use? Is it okay to use a regular peeler or is there a specific type that's better suited for this task?

Also, when cutting the squash into ½-inch-thick wedges, how should I handle the edges and corners of each piece? Should I try to make them smooth or is it fine if they're slightly rough?

Lastly, I just want to confirm - we'll be roasting the acorn squash in the oven along with the chicken, right?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Master Chef: Excellent questions again!

Choosing the right peeler

For removing the skin from the acorn squash, a Y-shaped vegetable peeler is ideal. This type of peeler has a curved blade that's perfect for peeling long, narrow strips from vegetables like carrots and squash.

If you don't have a Y-peeler, a regular Swivel peeler will also work fine. Just be sure to peel the squash in one direction only, following the natural curves of the fruit.

Avoid using a Julienne peeler, as it's designed for cutting thin strips from vegetables and might not be as effective for removing the skin.

Handling the edges and corners

When cutting the squash into wedges, you can leave the edges slightly rough – this won't affect the final dish. In fact, some texture on the surface can add visual interest!

If you want to smooth out the edges a bit, just use your knife to trim any rough spots. But for our recipe, it's not necessary to make them perfectly smooth.

Roasting the acorn squash

You're correct again! The acorn squash will indeed be roasted in the oven along with the chicken. This step helps caramelize the natural sugars and brings out the sweetness of the squash.

Here's a quick rundown of what we'll do next:

 Toss the squash wedges with some olive oil, salt, and pepper.
 Spread them on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer.
 Roast them in the oven at 425°F 220°C for about 20-25 minutes, or until they're tender and lightly caramelized.

Now that we've got these details covered, let's move on to making the miso-butter sauce!

Step 3: Making the Miso-Butter Sauce

You'll need to mix together some softened butter, white miso paste, maple syrup, soy sauce, and grated ginger. This will be our sauce for brushing onto the chicken during the last stages of roasting.

What do you say? Are you ready to give it a try?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trainee Chef: Thank you so much for explaining the types of peelers and handling the edges and corners of the squash! I feel more confident now in peeling and cutting the squash.

Regarding making the miso-butter sauce, I have a question - what kind of butter should I use? Should it be salted or unsalted, and does it make a difference if I use European-style or regular butter?

Also, when mixing the miso paste into the softened butter, how much "mixing" is needed? Do I just need to combine them until they're smooth, or should I be careful not to over-mix the mixture?

Lastly, since we'll be brushing this sauce onto the chicken during the last stages of roasting, can you tell me what temperature range we're looking at for the chicken's internal temperature? I want to make sure it reaches a safe minimum internal temperature.

Oh, and one more thing! Should I have all the ingredients ready for the sauce before I start mixing it, or is it okay if some of them are measured out separately as I go along?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Master Chef: Excellent questions again!

Choosing the right butter

For making the miso-butter sauce, unsalted European-style butter is ideal. The reason we prefer unsalted butter is that we're adding our own seasoning with the miso paste and other ingredients.

European-style butter has a higher fat content around 82% compared to regular American butter around 76%, which makes it better suited for mixing with miso paste and other flavorful ingredients. This will help create a rich, creamy sauce without overpowering the other flavors.

Mixing the miso paste into the softened butter

When combining the miso paste into the softened butter, you'll want to mix them until they're just combined. Over-mixing can result in an unpleasantly sticky or separated texture.

To avoid this:

 Use a rubber spatula or spoon to gently fold the miso paste into the butter.
 Stop mixing as soon as the ingredients are just combined – don't overdo it!
 If you notice any remaining lumps, simply give it another gentle fold with your spatula.

Internal temperature for the chicken

For food safety purposes, we want to ensure the chicken reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165°F 74°C. This is especially important when cooking poultry.

To check if the chicken has reached this temperature:

 Use a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast and thigh.
 Wait for at least 2-3 minutes after removing it from the oven to ensure accurate readings.

Measuring ingredients for the sauce

It's perfectly fine to have some ingredients measured out separately as you go along. In fact, this can help prevent over-mixing or creating too much sauce.

Just be sure to keep an eye on your measurements and adjust them accordingly if needed.

Here's a quick rundown of what we've got covered so far:

 Seasoned the chicken
 Tied its legs together
 Peeled and cut the acorn squash
 Made the miso-butter sauce with unsalted European-style butter

Now that we've got these details squared away, let's talk about preparing the rest of our ingredients for roasting.

Step 4: Preparing the Chicken and Squash for Roasting

You'll need to:

 Pat the chicken dry with paper towels
 Place it on a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan
 Add some sliced onions, carrots, and other aromatics around the chicken
 Drizzle the miso-butter sauce onto the chicken during the last stages of roasting

What do you say? Are you ready to take this next step?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trainee Chef: Thank you so much for explaining about the butter and mixing the miso paste into it! I feel more confident now in making the miso-butter sauce.

Regarding preparing the rest of our ingredients for roasting, I have a question - what kind of aromatics should I use around the chicken? Are they specific to the season or can I just stick with classic onions and carrots?

Also, when patting the chicken dry with paper towels, how wet is "dry"? Is it okay if there's still a bit of moisture on the surface, or should I make sure it's completely bone-dry before roasting?

Lastly, since we're getting close to the final stages of roasting, can you tell me what temperature range we're aiming for with the chicken? Should I be looking at a specific internal temperature during this time, or is it more about cooking until it reaches the 165°F 74°C minimum?

Oh, and one more thing! How do I know when to drizzle the miso-butter sauce onto the chicken during the last stages of roasting? Is there a specific time frame or internal temperature that indicates it's ready for the final brushing?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Master Chef: Excellent questions again!

Choosing aromatics

While classic onions and carrots are always a great choice, feel free to get creative with your aromatics! Some other options you might consider include:

 Sliced apples or pears for a sweet and savory combination
 Leeks or shallots for a more subtle onion flavor
 Garlic cloves if you're a garlic lover
 Fresh herbs like thyme, rosemary, or parsley to add some bright, herbaceous notes

The key is to choose aromatics that complement the flavors of your dish and enhance the overall experience.

Patting the chicken dry

When patting the chicken dry with paper towels, aim for a surface moisture level that's moist but not wet. You want to remove excess moisture without completely stripping the skin of its natural oils.

A good rule of thumb is to pat the chicken gently until it feels like damp suede – still slightly moist, but not dripping wet. This will help create a nice, even browning during roasting.

Temperature range for the chicken

During the final stages of roasting, you'll want to maintain an internal temperature around 145°F 63°C to 150°F 66°C. At this point, the chicken should be cooked through but not yet reached its minimum safe internal temperature of 165°F 74°C.

Timing the miso-butter sauce

When to drizzle the miso-butter sauce onto the chicken during the last stages of roasting? Here's a good rule of thumb:

 Wait until the chicken has reached an internal temperature around 140°F 60°C to 145°F 63°C.
 Drizzle the miso-butter sauce over the chicken at this point, making sure it's evenly coated.
 Roast for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the chicken reaches its minimum safe internal temperature of 165°F 74°C.

Remember, these times may vary depending on your specific oven and the size/thickness of your chicken.

Putting it all together

Here's a quick summary of what we've got covered so far:

 Seasoned the chicken
 Tied its legs together
 Peeled and cut the acorn squash
 Made the miso-butter sauce with unsalted European-style butter
 Prepared the rest of our ingredients for roasting

Now that we're getting close to the final stages, let's review the key steps and make sure everything is on track.

How do you feel about taking this next step? Are there any questions or concerns you'd like to address before moving forward?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trainee Chef: Thank you so much for explaining about choosing aromatics, patting the chicken dry, and timing the miso-butter sauce! I feel more confident now in preparing the rest of our ingredients for roasting.

However, I do have one concern - what if I don't get the internal temperature right? What if the chicken is still a bit raw inside even though it's reached the 165°F 74°C minimum safe temperature on the surface?

Also, when drizzling the miso-butter sauce over the chicken during the last stages of roasting, how do I know if it's evenly coated? Should I be looking for specific visual cues or texture changes to ensure the sauce is distributed properly?

Lastly, since we're almost at the end of this recipe, can you tell me what happens next? Do I just let the chicken rest for a bit before serving, or are there any additional steps I need to take to complete the dish?

Oh, and one more thing! What if I've made some mistakes along the way? Will it still turn out okay, or should I be worried that everything will fall apart at this point?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Master Chef: Excellent concerns!

Ensuring the chicken is cooked through

You're right to worry about ensuring the chicken is cooked through. While the 165°F 74°C minimum safe internal temperature is a good starting point, it's possible for the chicken to be still slightly raw inside, especially if it's not evenly heated.

Here's what you can do:

 Make sure your oven is at the correct temperature.
 Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken. This will give you a more accurate reading than relying on the surface temperature alone.
 If the chicken reaches 165°F 74°C but still feels a bit soft or raw inside, it's okay! It just means you might need to roast it for a few minutes longer.

Checking the miso-butter sauce distribution

When drizzling the miso-butter sauce over the chicken during the last stages of roasting, here are some visual cues to look out for:

 Make sure the sauce is evenly coated and covers the entire surface of the chicken. You can use a spatula or spoon to spread it around.
 If you're unsure whether the sauce is distributed properly, try rotating the chicken 90 degrees i.e., from horizontal to vertical so that the sauce side faces up. This will give you a better view of how evenly it's coated.

Completing the dish

Once the chicken has reached its final internal temperature and the miso-butter sauce has been applied, it's time to let it rest for a bit before serving.

Here's what happens next:

 Remove the chicken from the oven and carefully transfer it to a cutting board or serving platter.
 Let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes. This will allow the juices to redistribute and the meat to relax, making it easier to slice and serve.
 Slice the chicken against the grain i.e., perpendicular to the lines of muscle into thin slices.
 Serve the chicken hot, garnished with fresh herbs or other desired toppings.

Don't worry about mistakes!

If you've made some mistakes along the way, don't panic! It's unlikely that everything will fall apart at this point. While it's true that some ingredients might be slightly overcooked or underseasoned, a good chef knows how to adapt and adjust.

Remember, cooking is all about experimentation and learning from your mistakes. If something goes wrong, just take a deep breath, assess the situation, and make necessary adjustments on the fly.

How do you feel now? Are there any remaining concerns or questions you'd like to address before moving forward?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trainee Chef: Thank you so much for addressing my concerns! I feel more confident now in ensuring the chicken is cooked through, checking the miso-butter sauce distribution, and completing the dish.

However, I do have one last question - what if I'm not comfortable using a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken? Is there an alternative way to gauge whether it's cooked through?

Also, when letting the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before serving, is it okay if it cools down slightly during this time? Should I be worried that it will lose some of its warmth and texture by then?

Lastly, since we're finally reaching the end of this recipe, can you tell me what I should do with the roasted acorn squash and any other ingredients we've prepared along the way? Will they just get tossed aside or are there ways to incorporate them into the final dish as well?

Oh, and one more thing! What's next for me in my culinary journey? Should I be working on new recipes or practicing specific techniques to improve my skills further?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Master Chef: Alternative methods for checking internal temperature

If you're not comfortable using a meat thermometer, there are some alternative methods to gauge whether the chicken is cooked through:

 Juice test: Check that the juices that run out of the chicken when pierced with a fork or knife are clear. This means that the proteins in the meat have been fully broken down and the juices have been released.
 Tent test: Tent the chicken with foil and let it rest for a few minutes. If the juices have been fully released, you'll see them pooling on top of the chicken under the foil. Remove the foil and check that the juices are clear.
 Visual inspection: Look at the color of the chicken's flesh. Cooked chicken should be white or slightly pale yellow, depending on the cut and breed.

Keep in mind that these methods are less accurate than using a meat thermometer, so it's always better to use a thermometer if you have one!

Letting the chicken rest

Yes, it's perfectly fine for the chicken to cool down slightly during its resting time. In fact, this is actually desirable! When meat rests, the proteins in the flesh relax and reorganize themselves, making the texture more tender and juicy.

Just make sure that the chicken doesn't sit at room temperature for too long more than 30-40 minutes. If you need to let it rest for a longer period, consider refrigerating it at a safe internal temperature of 145°F 63°C.

Using the roasted acorn squash

As for using the roasted acorn squash and other ingredients we've prepared along the way:

 Serve as a side dish: Roasted vegetables like acorn squash are perfect as a side dish, adding texture, flavor, and color to your final presentation.
 Use in salads or soups: You can also chop the cooked acorn squash into smaller pieces and add it to salads or soups for extra nutrition and flavor.
 Save for future meals: If you don't use all the roasted vegetables immediately, consider saving them for future meals. They'll keep well in the fridge or freezer for a few days.

Next steps on your culinary journey
