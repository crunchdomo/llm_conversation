This ensures the chicken and squash cook evenly.\n\n2. Prepare the miso butter mixture: In a small bowl, mix the white miso and 3 tablespoons of room-temperature butter until they form a smooth paste. This mixture will add flavor and moisture to the chicken.\n\n3. Prepare the chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels to remove any moisture on the surface. This step helps achieve crispy skin during roasting.\n\n4. Coat the chicken with miso butter: Rub or brush the miso butter mixture all over the chicken, ensuring it's evenly coated. This will infuse the chicken with a rich umami flavor.\n\n5. Roast the chicken: Place the chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast it on the middle rack of the oven. Use an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature at the thickest part of the breast, aiming for 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C).

The squash will develop a caramelized exterior and become tender as it roasts.\n\n2. Add the bread mixture: Remove the baking sheet from the oven and scatter the reserved bread and apple mixture over the squash. Spread it out evenly in a layer on top of the squash.\n\n3.

This process, known as deglazing, helps incorporate the flavorful browned bits into the gravy.\n\n3. Reduce the wine: Cook the wine, stirring often, until it is reduced by about half. This concentrates the flavors and evaporates the alcohol, leaving behind a rich wine base for the gravy.\n\n4. Incorporate the butter mixture: Add the flour and butter mixture (beurre mani\u00e9) to the skillet. Stir constantly until a smooth paste forms. This will thicken the gravy and add a buttery flavor.\n\n5. Add broth and reserved drippings: Pour in the unsalted chicken broth and any reserved chicken drippings. Stir constantly to combine and thicken the gravy, ensuring a smooth and velvety texture.\n\n6. Stir in miso: Once the gravy is thickened and well combined, remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the white miso. The miso will add depth and umami flavor to the gravy.\n\n7.
