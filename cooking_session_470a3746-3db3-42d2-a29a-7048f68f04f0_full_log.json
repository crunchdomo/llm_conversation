Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\n\n        2. Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½\"\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\n        3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\n\n        4. Add bread, apples, oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\n        Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\n\n        5. Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\n\n        6. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until  mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\n\n        7. Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\n\n        8. Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\n\n        9. Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.\n------------------------------\nPlease recall all the ingredients before continuing."

      "content": "Letting the seasoned chicken sit at room temperature for 1 hour before roasting serves a few purposes:\n\n1. Even Cooking: By allowing the chicken to come to room temperature, you reduce the temperature difference between the outer and inner parts of the chicken. This results in more even cooking throughout the meat, helping to prevent dryness in some areas and juiciness in others.\n\n2. Flavor Infusion: Allowing the salt to penetrate the meat during this resting period enhances the flavor of the chicken. The seasoning has time to penetrate the outer layers, adding depth to the taste of the final dish.\n\n3. Better Texture: Room temperature chicken cooks more evenly, resulting in a juicier and more tender final product. Starting with a chicken that is not chilled helps maintain the desired texture throughout the meat.\n\nOverall, this resting period ensures that your chicken roasts more evenly, with enhanced flavor and better texture. Once you've let the seasoned chicken sit for an hour, you can proceed with the roasting process. Just say \"next\" when you're ready to move on to the next step."

Current step: 5.\nLast instruction: In this step, you'll be preheating the oven and preparing the chicken for roasting with a miso butter mixture. Here's a breakdown of the process:\n\n1. Preheat the oven: Position the racks in the middle and lower third of the oven and preheat it to 425°F. This ensures even cooking of the chicken and squash in their respective places in the oven.\n\n2. Prepare the miso butter mixture: In a small bowl, combine the white miso and 3 tablespoons of room-temperature butter until they form a smooth paste. This mixture adds savory umami flavor to the chicken and helps create a golden and flavorful crust during roasting.\n\n3. Coat the chicken with the miso butter: Pat the seasoned chicken dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Then, rub or brush the miso butter mixture all over the chicken, ensuring it's evenly coated. This step infuses the chicken with rich miso flavor while adding moisture and ensuring a crispy skin.\n\n4. Roast the chicken: Place the prepared chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast it on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155°F, which typically takes about 50-60 minutes. The internal temperature will continue to rise to 165°F as the chicken rests.\n\n5. Rest the chicken: Allow the roasted chicken to rest in the skillet for at least 5 minutes after cooking before transferring it to a plate. This resting period allows the juices inside the chicken to redistribute, resulting in a juicier and more flavorful meat.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll achieve a perfectly roasted chicken with a flavorful miso butter crust.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. Roast the squash: After roasting the chicken, continue cooking the acorn squash on the lower rack of the oven until it is mostly tender. This typically takes about 25 minutes, allowing the squash to roast and develop a sweet and caramelized flavor.\n\n2. Add the bread mixture: Once the squash is mostly tender, remove the baking sheet from the oven and scatter the reserved bread, apple, and herb mixture over the cooked squash.

This second roasting phase enhances the texture and flavor of the bread, apples, and squash.\n\n4. Combine with pickled onions: After removing the panzanella from the oven, drain the pickled onions that have been sitting and toss them with the roasted mixture to combine. The tangy pickled onions add a vibrant and zesty contrast to the roasted squash and bread mixture.\n\n5.

        "prompt": "You're following a recipe with 9 steps. Current step: 7.\nLast instruction: In step 7, you will be creating a mixture of flour and butter to thicken and enrich the gravy for the roast chicken. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:\n\n1. Combine flour and butter: In a small bowl, add the all-purpose flour and room-temperature unsalted butter. Using your fingers, mash and mix the two ingredients together until they form a smooth paste-like consistency. This mixture is called a beurre manié and acts as a thickening agent for the gravy.\n\n2. Ensure thorough combining: It's important to fully incorporate the flour and butter to create a lump-free paste. This step prepares the beurre manié, which will be used to thicken the gravy and give it a velvety texture.\n\n3. Set aside the mixture: Once the flour and butter are well combined, set the bowl aside until it's ready to be incorporated into the gravy during the cooking process.\n\nBy following this step, you'll have the beurre manié ready to thicken the gravy for the roast chicken.

        "prompt": "You're following a recipe with 9 steps. Current step: 8.\nLast instruction: In step 8 of the recipe, you will be preparing the gravy for the roast chicken. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:\n\n1. Heat the skillet with chicken drippings: Place the skillet containing the chicken drippings over medium heat on the stovetop. The drippings are full of flavorful juices and tidbits from roasting the chicken and will form the base of the rich gravy.\n\n2. Add wine and deglaze: Pour the white wine into the skillet with the drippings, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. This process, known as deglazing, lifts the flavorful browned bits and incorporates them into the gravy.\n\n3. Reduce the wine: Cook the wine for about 2 minutes, allowing it to reduce by half. You should notice the aroma of the wine intensifying as it reduces, concentrating its flavors and ensuring a well-balanced gravy base.\n\n4. Incorporate the butter mixture: Once the wine is reduced, add the flour and butter mixture (beurre manié) to the skillet. Stir continuously to create a smooth paste, which will help thicken the gravy and provide a luscious texture.\n\n5. Add broth and reserved drippings: Pour the unsalted chicken broth into the skillet, along with any reserved drippings from the chicken. Stir constantly to combine the ingredients and thicken the gravy. The flavors will marry, creating a savory and aromatic sauce.\n\n6. Stir in miso: Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the white miso, adding a touch of umami richness to the gravy. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper as needed to achieve the desired flavor.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll create a flavorful and velvety gravy to accompany the roast chicken.
