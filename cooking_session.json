Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\n\n        2. Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into \u00bd\"\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\n        3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and \u00bd tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\n\n        4. Add bread, apples, oil, and \u00bc tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\n        Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\n\n        5. Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155\u00b0F, 50\u201360 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165\u00b0F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\n\n        6. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\n\n        7. Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\n\n        8. Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about \u00bc cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6\u20138 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\n\n        9. Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.\n            "

Here\u2019s how we proceed:\n\n### Step 1: Preparing the Chicken\n\n**Ingredients Needed:**\n- A whole chicken\n- Kosher salt\n- Freshly ground black pepper\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Pat Dry:** Take your whole chicken and pat it dry with paper towels. This helps ensure that the chicken cooks evenly without any moisture interfering with the seasoning process.\n\n2. **Seasoning:** Season the chicken all over with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. Remember to sprinkle some additional salt around the chicken's surface before tying the legs together.\n\n3. **Tying Legs Together:** Tie the legs of the chicken together using kitchen twine. This helps hold the leg joints tight during roasting, ensuring even cooking throughout the bird.\n\n4. **Let Sit:** Allow the seasoned chicken to sit at room temperature for one hour. Room temperature ingredients help achieve better flavor development and browning during cooking.\n\n5. **Preparation for Roasting:** Now that the chicken is prepared, let it sit at room temperature for at least one hour before starting the cooking process.\n\nThis preparation ensures that the chicken"

Moving forward to step 2 of our Miso-Butter Roast Chicken With Acorn Squash Panzanella recipe. \n\n### Step 2: Preparing the Acorn Squash\n\n**Ingredients Needed:**\n- Small acorn squash (about 3 lbs total)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Squash:** Halve the acorn squash lengthwise. Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the outer skin of each squash half. Then, slice each half crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. This will make it easier to clean and cook the squash later.\n\n2. **Coring the Squash:** Run a knife down the center of each squash wedge to create a slit, which then use the tip of the knife to carefully remove the core. Discard the cores.\n\n3. **Cutting the Squash:** Once the cores are removed, cut each squash half into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Arrange these wedges on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\nThese steps are crucial for preparing the squash for roasting, making sure they fit well on the baking sheet and are easy to handle when cooked.\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, you'll move onto"
