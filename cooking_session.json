    "content": "Great! We're ready for step 1 now. Here's what comes next in our recipe:\n\n1. **Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine.**\n\nTo start, take your seasoned chicken and gently pat it dry using paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Next, sprinkle 2 teaspoons of kosher salt evenly across the entire surface of the chicken. Finally, tie the chicken\u2019s legs together with kitchen twine to create neat folds along both sides. This not only adds an attractive appearance to the bird but also helps in keeping the meat juices inside while cooking."

    "content": "Alright! Moving forward from step 1 where we've prepared the chicken, let's proceed to the next crucial step:\n\n2. **Halve squash and scoop out seeds...**\n\nNext up, halve the acorn squash. Once they\u2019re halved, use a spoon to carefully scoop out the seeds from the center of each half. Be careful not to damage the flesh of the squash as much as possible. If you find some tough sections, feel free to discard those without affecting the taste too much.\n\nThis step ensures that the squash has a smooth texture when roasted, which enhances the overall flavor of the dish.\n\nThat concludes step 2. Keep following the recipe for the rest of the preparation stages!"
