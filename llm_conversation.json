Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\n\n        2. Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½\"\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\n        3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\n\n        4. Add bread, apples, oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\n        Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\n\n        5. Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\n\n        6. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\n\n        7. Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\n\n        8. Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\n\n        9. Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.\n------------------------------. First recall all the ingredients before continuing with the step-by-step guidance.",

    "content": "Yes, you can use different types of flour such as whole wheat flour or almond flour for this recipe. Here's how each might affect your mixture:\n\n1. **Whole Wheat Flour:** This will give a denser and more textured result. It has a stronger, nuttier flavor, which can enhance savory dishes. You might need to adjust the moisture content slightly, as whole wheat flour absorbs more liquid.\n\n2. **Almond Flour:** This is a gluten-free option that provides a sweet, nutty flavor. It’s lighter and can create a crumbly texture. When using almond flour, the binding properties are different from wheat flours, so the mixture might not hold together as well. You may need to experiment with adding more binding agents or adjusting the amount of butter.\n\nEach type of flour brings its unique properties to the dish, so consider what texture and flavor you are aiming for in your final product.",

    "content": "Step 8: Place the skillet that was used for cooking the chicken back on the stove over medium heat. Ensure there are about ¼ cup of chicken drippings in the skillet; it's okay if it's slightly more or less. If there is significantly more, you should drain off the excess and set it aside.\n\nNext, add wine to the skillet. Stir often while scraping up any browned bits that have stuck to the bottom of the skillet using a wooden spoon. Continue cooking until the wine has reduced by about half, which should take around 2 minutes—you'll know it's reduced enough when you can distinctly smell the wine.\n\nNow, add the butter and flour mixture you prepared earlier. Stir frequently until it forms a smooth paste, which should take about 2 minutes.\n\nThen, pour in the broth and any reserved drippings. Continue stirring constantly. Cook this mixture until it is thoroughly combined and has thickened, which will take about 6–8 minutes.\n\nOnce done, remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the miso paste. Taste the sauce and season it with salt and black pepper as needed.\n\nLet me know when you're ready to move on to the next step by saying 'next'.",

Here are a few alternatives that can work well depending on the flavor profile you're aiming for:\n\n1. **Beer:** A good option for a richer, more malty flavor. Darker beers like stouts or porters can add depth to the sauce.\n\n2. **Sherry:** If you want a sweeter note with a bit of nuttiness, sherry can be a great choice. It works particularly well in sauces for meats.\n\n3. **Vermouth:** A suitable substitute for wine, vermouth is especially good in sauces due to its aromatic and slightly herbal flavor.\n\n4. **Apple Cider:** For a non-alcoholic option, apple cider offers a nice sweetness and acidity that can mimic the role of wine in deglazing and enriching a sauce.\n\nEach option will change the flavor of your sauce slightly, so choose one that complements the other ingredients in your dish.",

The key is to choose a bread that is sturdy enough to hold up when mixed with the other ingredients and dressing.
