The first step is all about prepping your chicken properly:\n\n- Patting the chicken dry with paper towels removes excess moisture from the skin. This is important because dry skin crisps up better in the oven, giving you a beautifully roasted exterior.\n\n- Next, season the entire chicken evenly with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. Salt helps to enhance flavor and also draws out moisture, improving the skin texture as it roasts.\n\n- Tying the legs together with kitchen twine is called trussing. This keeps the chicken compact so it cooks evenly and looks neat when served. To do this, you wrap the twine around the legs and tie them snugly but not too tight.\n\n- Finally, letting the chicken sit at room temperature for about 1 hour helps it cook more evenly. If the chicken is too cold coming out of the fridge, the inside might cook slower than the skin.\n\nDo you want me to give you tips on how to truss the chicken, or shall we proceed to the next step?",

It also helps the chicken hold a compact shape, making it look nicer when served.\n\nNow, moving on to Step 2 about preparing the acorn squash:\n\n- Start by cutting each acorn squash in half lengthwise.\n\n- Use a spoon to scoop out all the seeds and stringy bits from the hollow center of each half.\n\n- Acorn squash has ridges running down its sides, making the skin uneven and tough. To remove it, run a vegetable peeler carefully along those ridges to peel off the skin.\n\n- Once peeled, slice each half into wedges about half an inch thick. Keeping the wedges uniform helps them cook evenly.\n\n- Finally, arrange the squash wedges on a rimmed baking sheet. The rim will catch any juices that release as they roast.\n\nLet me know if you'd like tips on how to peel the acorn squash safely or if you're ready to continue to the next step!",

Acorn squash has a tough, ridged skin, so take your time and work over a stable surface.\n\n- Another option is to skip peeling before roasting: you can roast the halved and seeded squash with skin on, then scoop out the tender flesh afterward. The skin becomes softer when roasted, but keep in mind that it’s not edible.\n\nNow, moving on to Step 3:\n\n- In a large bowl, you combine the finely chopped sage and rosemary with 6 tablespoons of melted butter. This creates a fragrant herb butter that will flavor the squash.\n\n- Pour half of this herb butter mixture over the prepared squash wedges on the baking sheet.\n\n- Then sprinkle the squash with ground allspice, crushed red pepper flakes (for a touch of heat), ½ teaspoon of salt, and freshly ground black pepper.\n\n- Toss everything together gently so each squash wedge is evenly coated with the flavorful butter and seasonings.

Since dried herbs are more concentrated, use about one-third of the amount—for example, replace 2 tablespoons fresh sage with 2 teaspoons dried sage, and 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary with 1 teaspoon dried. \n\nAlternatively, thyme or a mix of Italian herbs can provide a nice flavor profile. If none of these are available, a pinch of dried parsley combined with a little dried oregano could work well too.\n\nNow, for Step 4:\n\n- Add the torn white bread and the cut apples into the bowl containing the remaining herb butter mixture from Step 3.\n\n- Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon of salt and season with freshly ground black pepper.\n\n- Toss everything gently to coat the bread and apples evenly with the herbed butter and seasoning. This will help the bread crisp up nicely and the apples to roast with good flavor.\n\n- In a small separate bowl, place the thinly sliced red onion, then pour in the apple cider vinegar.\n\n- Season with a bit of salt and toss to coat the onions thoroughly.\n\n- Let the onions sit, tossing them occasionally, while you continue prepping.

Explanation of Step 5 covering oven placement, miso butter mixture, patting and roasting chicken, temperature targets, and resting.\n\nResponse plan:\n\n- For vinegar substitution, explain white vinegar can be used but apple cider vinegar adds a milder, fruitier flavor. Suggest adjusting amount or adding a pinch of sugar to balance sharpness if needed.\n\n- For Step 5:\n  - Explain why oven racks are placed middle and lower third—different roasting tasks.\n  - Mixing miso and softened butter creates a flavorful, spreadable paste to coat chicken.\n  - Patting chicken dry is essential before applying miso butter to ensure adhesion and crisping.\n  - Roasting the chicken in a cast-iron skillet helps even heat distribution.\n  - Monitor internal temp with instant-read thermometer; 155°F is target because it will rise to safe 165°F during resting.\n  - Resting keeps juices in the meat and helps finish cooking gently.\n  - Reserve skillet with drippings for making gravy.\n\nAnswer thoroughly and clearly before waiting for next user input.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Regarding your vinegar question first:\n\nYou can use regular white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar for the onions. White vinegar has a sharper, more acidic taste compared to the milder, fruitier apple cider vinegar. If you find white vinegar too strong, you can mellow it slightly by adding a pinch of sugar or diluting it a bit with water. Either way, your pickled onions will still add great tang and brightness to the dish.\n\nNow, let me explain Step 5:\n\n- Place oven racks in the middle and lower third positions and preheat your oven to 425°F. This setup lets you cook the chicken and the squash simultaneously but at different levels for optimal roasting.\n\n- In a small bowl, mix 3 tablespoons of room-temperature butter with 1 tablespoon of white miso until smooth. This creates a rich, savory miso butter paste that imparts deep flavor and helps brown the chicken skin.\n\n- Pat the chicken dry once again with paper towels before applying the miso butter. Ensuring the skin is dry helps the butter adhere well and promotes a crisp, golden roast.\n\n- Rub or brush the miso butter all over the chicken evenly, covering the skin thoroughly.\n\n- Place the chicken in a large cast-iron skillet on the middle oven rack. The cast iron provides even heat distribution and collects flavorful drippings for later use.\n\n- Roast the chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 155°F. This should take about 50–60 minutes. The internal temperature will continue to rise to 165°F during the resting period, which is the safe temperature to eat poultry.\n\n- Let the chicken rest in the skillet for at least 5 minutes after roasting. Resting allows the juices to redistribute in the meat for a moist and tender result.\n\n- After resting, transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve the skillet and its drippings for making the gravy in a later step.\n\nWould you like any tips on using an instant-read thermometer or how to tell if your chicken is done? Or should we move on?",

Explanation for Step 6: roasting squash until mostly tender, adding bread mixture on top, continuing roasting, draining pickled onions, tossing them together, and transferring to serving dish.\n\nFor white miso substitute:\n- Suggest other types of miso (yellow or mild red).\n- If miso unavailable, alternatives like light soy sauce with a bit of miso paste substitute (if accessible).\n- Umami-rich condiments like tahini with a bit of salt or even a mild miso-style fermented bean paste.\n- Emphasize that flavor changes but still can be tasty.\n\nFor Step 6:\n- The squash is partially cooked first.\n- Bread, apples, and herb butter mixture (panzanella) then scattered on top to crisp during final roasting.\n- Apples soften and bread crisps adding texture contrast.\n- Drained pickled onions add brightness.\n- Everything is gently tossed to blend flavors before serving.\n\nResponse will explain Step 6 and then answer miso substitute question thoroughly.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Let's start with Step 6:\n\n- After roasting the acorn squash on the lower oven rack for about 25 minutes until it’s mostly tender, you take the baking sheet out of the oven.\n\n- Then, you scatter the reserved bread mixture—this includes the torn bread, apples, and herbed butter—from earlier evenly over the roasted squash wedges on the baking sheet.\n\n- Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast it again until the bread pieces are golden brown and crisp, and the apples have softened nicely. This should take about 15 minutes.\n\n- Once roasting is complete, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Drain the pickled onions you prepared earlier and toss them together with the roasted squash and crisp bread-apple mixture. This combines the savory, tender, crispy, and tangy elements for a balanced panzanella salad.\n\n- Finally, transfer this squash panzanella mixture onto a serving dish, ready to accompany your miso-butter roast chicken.\n\nNow, regarding your question about substituting white miso in the miso butter mixture:\n\n- If you have other types of miso like yellow or mild red miso, those can work as substitutes though the flavor will be a bit stronger or earthier.\n\n- If you don't have miso at all, you could try mixing a small amount of light soy sauce with a tiny bit of tahini or even peanut butter to mimic the umami and creamy texture, but keep in mind it won’t be an exact match.\n\n- Another option is to use a small spoonful of fermented bean paste if available, although these can have a more intense flavor.\n\n- The key is to maintain the savory, slightly salty, and umami profile that miso brings to the butter.\n\nWould you like more suggestions for substitutions or have questions about the roasting times? Or shall we move on to the next step?",

Tahini has a rich, nutty, and slightly bitter taste, and while it provides creaminess, it doesn’t have the characteristic salty, fermented umami depth that miso brings. \n\nIf you go with tahini, I recommend adding a bit of salt or a splash of soy sauce to introduce some savory notes that miso would normally provide. This way, your sauce will still have that satisfying depth and balance, though it will be a different flavor profile—more nutty and less tangy-fermented.\n\nNow, about Step 7:\n\nThis step involves using your fingers to mash the all-purpose flour and room-temperature butter together in a small bowl. What you’re making here is called a beurre manié, which is a French term for a paste made of equal parts flour and butter.\n\nWhy do this?\n\n- By thoroughly combining the flour and butter, you coat the flour particles with fat, which helps prevent lumps when you later add this mixture to the liquid in the gravy.\n\n- Using your fingers gives you great control to blend the two until they form a smooth, slightly pliable paste. This tactile method is often easier than trying to mix with a spoon or whisk.\n\nThis beurre manié will then be added to the skillet juices in upcoming steps to thicken your miso gravy to a silky, luscious consistency.\n\nWould you like tips on how to add this mixture to your sauce smoothly or shall we continue to the next step?",

Softened butter mixes much more easily and evenly with the flour, allowing you to create a smooth, lump-free paste. \n\nIf you use cold butter straight from the fridge, it’s harder to mash and blend well with the flour, which can result in clumps that won’t incorporate smoothly into your sauce. While it’s possible to use cold butter, it will require more effort and might lead to a grainier texture in your gravy.\n\nNow, for Step 8 explained in detail:\n\n- Set your reserved cast-iron skillet with the chicken drippings over medium heat on the stove. You want about ¼ cup of drippings; if there's significantly more, drain off the excess and save it aside—you can add it back later if needed.\n\n- Pour in the ¼ cup of dry white wine. Use a wooden spoon to stir often, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. These browned bits, called “fond,” are packed with flavor and create a tasty base for your gravy.\n\n- Cook and stir until the wine reduces by about half, which should take roughly 2 minutes. You’ll notice the wine smell more intensely as it concentrates and the alcohol cooks off.\n\n- Next, add the butter-flour (beurre manié) mixture you prepared. Stir constantly as you cook for about 2 minutes until a smooth, thick paste forms in the pan. This acts similarly to a roux and will thicken your sauce.\n\n- Slowly add the 2 cups of unsalted chicken broth and any reserved drippings back to the skillet while stirring constantly. This helps to evenly incorporate the liquid and prevents lumps.\n\n- Continue cooking and stirring for another 6 to 8 minutes until the sauce combines well and thickens to a gravy-like consistency.\n\n- Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in 2 teaspoons of white miso. The miso melts into the gravy, adding a rich, savory umami depth.\n\n- Finally, taste your gravy and adjust seasoning with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.\n\nWould you like tips on deglazing the pan without burning, or how to tell if your gravy has thickened properly?

This can overpower the delicate, savory miso butter flavors and the lightness of the chicken. If you’re comfortable with a stronger flavor profile, go ahead and use red wine, but I recommend using a slightly smaller amount or balancing it with a bit more chicken broth to keep the gravy well balanced.\n\nNow, moving on to Step 9—serving your dish:\n\n- Start by carving your rested miso-butter roast chicken into pieces (breast, thigh, drumstick).\n\n- Arrange the chicken pieces attractively on a serving platter.\n\n- Spoon a generous amount of the luscious miso gravy over the chicken or serve it on the side so guests can add as much as they like.\n\n- Add the warm acorn squash panzanella alongside the chicken. This side adds a wonderful mix of tender squash, crisp toasted bread, sweet roasted apples, and tangy pickled onions — a beautiful balance of textures and flavors.\n\n- If you like, finish the plate with a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper or a few fresh herb leaves (such as sage or rosemary) for extra color and aroma.\n\nEnjoy your meal!

It’s a wonderfully flavorful and satisfying dish.\n\nAbout your question on preparing the squash panzanella ahead of time: to preserve its delightful mix of textures, it’s best to prepare and roast the squash and bread-apple mixture separately, then store them in airtight containers. Keep the pickled onions refrigerated separately as well. When you're ready to serve, gently reheat the squash and bread mixture in the oven to regain some crispness, then toss everything together with the drained pickled onions just before plating. This approach helps maintain the contrast between the tender squash, crispy bread, and tangy onions.\n\nIf you want any final tips on serving, storing leftovers, or reheating, feel free to ask.

The first step is all about prepping your chicken properly:\n\n- Patting the chicken dry with paper towels removes excess moisture from the skin. This is important because dry skin crisps up better in the oven, giving you a beautifully roasted exterior.\n\n- Next, season the entire chicken evenly with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. Salt helps to enhance flavor and also draws out moisture, improving the skin texture as it roasts.\n\n- Tying the legs together with kitchen twine is called trussing. This keeps the chicken compact so it cooks evenly and looks neat when served. To do this, you wrap the twine around the legs and tie them snugly but not too tight.\n\n- Finally, letting the chicken sit at room temperature for about 1 hour helps it cook more evenly.

It also helps the chicken hold a compact shape, making it look nicer when served.\n\nNow, moving on to Step 2 about preparing the acorn squash:\n\n- Start by cutting each acorn squash in half lengthwise.\n\n- Use a spoon to scoop out all the seeds and stringy bits from the hollow center of each half.\n\n- Acorn squash has ridges running down its sides, making the skin uneven and tough. To remove it, run a vegetable peeler carefully along those ridges to peel off the skin.\n\n- Once peeled, slice each half into wedges about half an inch thick. Keeping the wedges uniform helps them cook evenly.\n\n- Finally, arrange the squash wedges on a rimmed baking sheet. The rim will catch any juices that release as they roast.\n\nLet me know if you'd like tips on how to peel the acorn squash safely or if you're ready to continue to the next step!\nAsk ONE SHORT, direct question to the chef about either ingredient substitutions or cooking technique for this step.

Acorn squash has a tough, ridged skin, so take your time and work over a stable surface.\n\n- Another option is to skip peeling before roasting: you can roast the halved and seeded squash with skin on, then scoop out the tender flesh afterward. The skin becomes softer when roasted, but keep in mind that it’s not edible.\n\nNow, moving on to Step 3:\n\n- In a large bowl, you combine the finely chopped sage and rosemary with 6 tablespoons of melted butter. This creates a fragrant herb butter that will flavor the squash.\n\n- Pour half of this herb butter mixture over the prepared squash wedges on the baking sheet.\n\n- Then sprinkle the squash with ground allspice, crushed red pepper flakes (for a touch of heat), ½ teaspoon of salt, and freshly ground black pepper.\n\n- Toss everything together gently so each squash wedge is evenly coated with the flavorful butter and seasonings.

Current step: 4.\nLast instruction: <recipe_analysis>\nUser asked for substitutes for fresh sage and rosemary before moving on to Step 4 explanation.\n\nSubstitutes:\n- Dried sage and rosemary can be used at about one-third the amount of fresh herbs (because dried herbs are more concentrated).\n- Alternatively, savory herbs like thyme or a pinch of dried Italian seasoning can work.\n- If no herbs available, using herb blends or even a small amount of dried parsley combined with a touch of dried oregano can mimic the flavor.\n\nFor Step 4 explanation:\n- Add bread, apples, olive oil, and salt to the leftover herb butter from step 3.\n- Season with black pepper and toss to coat evenly — this flavors and slightly moistens the bread and apples, preparing for roasting.\n- Separately, put the sliced red onion in apple cider vinegar, add salt, and toss to start quick pickling.\n- Let onions sit, tossing occasionally, until serving time, so they soften and develop flavor.\n- This step readies the bread-apple mixture to become crunchy and flavorful during roasting and the onions for freshness and tang.\n\nAnswer the substitution question then provide the explanation for Step 4 clearly.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: For your question about fresh herbs substitutes: \n\nIf you don’t have fresh sage and rosemary, you can use dried versions instead. Since dried herbs are more concentrated, use about one-third of the amount—for example, replace 2 tablespoons fresh sage with 2 teaspoons dried sage, and 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary with 1 teaspoon dried. \n\nAlternatively, thyme or a mix of Italian herbs can provide a nice flavor profile. If none of these are available, a pinch of dried parsley combined with a little dried oregano could work well too.\n\nNow, for Step 4:\n\n- Add the torn white bread and the cut apples into the bowl containing the remaining herb butter mixture from Step 3.\n\n- Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon of salt and season with freshly ground black pepper.\n\n- Toss everything gently to coat the bread and apples evenly with the herbed butter and seasoning. This will help the bread crisp up nicely and the apples to roast with good flavor.\n\n- In a small separate bowl, place the thinly sliced red onion, then pour in the apple cider vinegar.\n\n- Season with a bit of salt and toss to coat the onions thoroughly.\n\n- Let the onions sit, tossing them occasionally, while you continue prepping.

Explanation of Step 5 covering oven placement, miso butter mixture, patting and roasting chicken, temperature targets, and resting.\n\nResponse plan:\n\n- For vinegar substitution, explain white vinegar can be used but apple cider vinegar adds a milder, fruitier flavor. Suggest adjusting amount or adding a pinch of sugar to balance sharpness if needed.\n\n- For Step 5:\n  - Explain why oven racks are placed middle and lower third—different roasting tasks.\n  - Mixing miso and softened butter creates a flavorful, spreadable paste to coat chicken.\n  - Patting chicken dry is essential before applying miso butter to ensure adhesion and crisping.\n  - Roasting the chicken in a cast-iron skillet helps even heat distribution.\n  - Monitor internal temp with instant-read thermometer; 155°F is target because it will rise to safe 165°F during resting.\n  - Resting keeps juices in the meat and helps finish cooking gently.\n  - Reserve skillet with drippings for making gravy.\n\nAnswer thoroughly and clearly before waiting for next user input.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Regarding your vinegar question first:\n\nYou can use regular white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar for the onions. White vinegar has a sharper, more acidic taste compared to the milder, fruitier apple cider vinegar. If you find white vinegar too strong, you can mellow it slightly by adding a pinch of sugar or diluting it a bit with water. Either way, your pickled onions will still add great tang and brightness to the dish.\n\nNow, let me explain Step 5:\n\n- Place oven racks in the middle and lower third positions and preheat your oven to 425°F. This setup lets you cook the chicken and the squash simultaneously but at different levels for optimal roasting.\n\n- In a small bowl, mix 3 tablespoons of room-temperature butter with 1 tablespoon of white miso until smooth. This creates a rich, savory miso butter paste that imparts deep flavor and helps brown the chicken skin.\n\n- Pat the chicken dry once again with paper towels before applying the miso butter. Ensuring the skin is dry helps the butter adhere well and promotes a crisp, golden roast.\n\n- Rub or brush the miso butter all over the chicken evenly, covering the skin thoroughly.\n\n- Place the chicken in a large cast-iron skillet on the middle oven rack. The cast iron provides even heat distribution and collects flavorful drippings for later use.\n\n- Roast the chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 155°F. This should take about 50–60 minutes. The internal temperature will continue to rise to 165°F during the resting period, which is the safe temperature to eat poultry.\n\n- Let the chicken rest in the skillet for at least 5 minutes after roasting. Resting allows the juices to redistribute in the meat for a moist and tender result.\n\n- After resting, transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve the skillet and its drippings for making the gravy in a later step.\n\nWould you like any tips on using an instant-read thermometer or how to tell if your chicken is done?

This should take about 15 minutes.\n\n- Once roasting is complete, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Drain the pickled onions you prepared earlier and toss them together with the roasted squash and crisp bread-apple mixture. This combines the savory, tender, crispy, and tangy elements for a balanced panzanella salad.\n\n- Finally, transfer this squash panzanella mixture onto a serving dish, ready to accompany your miso-butter roast chicken.\n\nNow, regarding your question about substituting white miso in the miso butter mixture:\n\n- If you have other types of miso like yellow or mild red miso, those can work as substitutes though the flavor will be a bit stronger or earthier.\n\n- If you don't have miso at all, you could try mixing a small amount of light soy sauce with a tiny bit of tahini or even peanut butter to mimic the umami and creamy texture, but keep in mind it won’t be an exact match.\n\n- Another option is to use a small spoonful of fermented bean paste if available, although these can have a more intense flavor.\n\n- The key is to maintain the savory, slightly salty, and umami profile that miso brings to the butter.\n\nWould you like more suggestions for substitutions or have questions about the roasting times?

Current step: 7.\nLast instruction: <recipe_analysis>\nUser asked about flavor impact of using tahini instead of miso, and then requested explanation of Step 7: mashing flour and butter together by hand.\n\nFor tahini substitute:\n- Tahini offers a nutty flavor and creamy texture.\n- It lacks the salty, fermented umami depth of miso.\n- Using tahini will alter the flavor, making it milder and nuttier, less savory.\n- May need to add a bit of salt or soy sauce to compensate.\n\nFor Step 7 explanation:\n- Mashing flour and butter together by hand is preparing a beurre manié, a thickening paste used in gravies and sauces.\n- This step helps to integrate fat and flour evenly to prevent lumps when added to liquids.\n- Using fingers is preferred for better control and tactile feedback.\n\nWill explain the flavor difference of tahini clearly and thoroughly, then introduce Step 7 technique and its purpose.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Using tahini instead of miso will definitely affect the overall flavor balance of your miso butter mixture. Tahini has a rich, nutty, and slightly bitter taste, and while it provides creaminess, it doesn’t have the characteristic salty, fermented umami depth that miso brings. \n\nIf you go with tahini, I recommend adding a bit of salt or a splash of soy sauce to introduce some savory notes that miso would normally provide. This way, your sauce will still have that satisfying depth and balance, though it will be a different flavor profile—more nutty and less tangy-fermented.\n\nNow, about Step 7:\n\nThis step involves using your fingers to mash the all-purpose flour and room-temperature butter together in a small bowl. What you’re making here is called a beurre manié, which is a French term for a paste made of equal parts flour and butter.\n\nWhy do this?\n\n- By thoroughly combining the flour and butter, you coat the flour particles with fat, which helps prevent lumps when you later add this mixture to the liquid in the gravy.\n\n- Using your fingers gives you great control to blend the two until they form a smooth, slightly pliable paste. This tactile method is often easier than trying to mix with a spoon or whisk.\n\nThis beurre manié will then be added to the skillet juices in upcoming steps to thicken your miso gravy to a silky, luscious consistency.\n\nWould you like tips on how to add this mixture to your sauce smoothly or shall we continue to the next step?\nAsk ONE SHORT, direct question to the chef about either ingredient substitutions or cooking technique for this step.

Current step: 8.\nLast instruction: <recipe_analysis>\nUser asked if cold butter can be used instead of room-temperature butter for making beurre manié, and now requested an explanation of Step 8 in detail.\n\nFor the cold butter question:\n- Room-temperature butter blends more easily with flour to create smooth paste.\n- Cold butter is harder to mash evenly, can result in uneven lumps.\n- Emphasize the importance of softened butter for a lump-free beurre manié.\n- Possible to use cold butter but requires more effort and risks uneven mixture.\n\nFor Step 8:\n- Explain heating skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat; amount of drippings should be around ¼ cup.\n- If too much drippings, drain off excess and save it to adjust gravy later.\n- Adding white wine to deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape browned bits (fond), which adds flavor.\n- Reducing wine by half concentrates the flavor and cooks off alcohol.\n- Adding beurre manié (flour-butter paste) and cooking helps form a roux-like paste for thickening.\n- Gradually adding chicken broth and reserved drippings while stirring to combine and thicken sauce.\n- Final addition of miso for umami and seasoning adjustment with salt and pepper.\n- Mention continual stirring for smooth texture.\n\nAnswer cold butter question first then thoroughly explain Step 8.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Let's start with your question about the beurre manié:\n\nIt’s best to use room-temperature (softened) butter when making beurre manié. Softened butter mixes much more easily and evenly with the flour, allowing you to create a smooth, lump-free paste. \n\nIf you use cold butter straight from the fridge, it’s harder to mash and blend well with the flour, which can result in clumps that won’t incorporate smoothly into your sauce. While it’s possible to use cold butter, it will require more effort and might lead to a grainier texture in your gravy.\n\nNow, for Step 8 explained in detail:\n\n- Set your reserved cast-iron skillet with the chicken drippings over medium heat on the stove. You want about ¼ cup of drippings; if there's significantly more, drain off the excess and save it aside—you can add it back later if needed.\n\n- Pour in the ¼ cup of dry white wine. Use a wooden spoon to stir often, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. These browned bits, called “fond,” are packed with flavor and create a tasty base for your gravy.\n\n- Cook and stir until the wine reduces by about half, which should take roughly 2 minutes. You’ll notice the wine smell more intensely as it concentrates and the alcohol cooks off.\n\n- Next, add the butter-flour (beurre manié) mixture you prepared. Stir constantly as you cook for about 2 minutes until a smooth, thick paste forms in the pan. This acts similarly to a roux and will thicken your sauce.\n\n- Slowly add the 2 cups of unsalted chicken broth and any reserved drippings back to the skillet while stirring constantly. This helps to evenly incorporate the liquid and prevents lumps.\n\n- Continue cooking and stirring for another 6 to 8 minutes until the sauce combines well and thickens to a gravy-like consistency.\n\n- Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in 2 teaspoons of white miso. The miso melts into the gravy, adding a rich, savory umami depth.\n\n- Finally, taste your gravy and adjust seasoning with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.\n\nWould you like tips on deglazing the pan without burning, or how to tell if your gravy has thickened properly?
