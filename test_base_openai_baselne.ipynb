            "Chef: Letting the chicken sit at room temperature for an hour as described in Step 1 helps in a couple of ways. First, it allows the salt to season the chicken more deeply, enhancing its flavor throughout. Second, bringing the chicken closer to room temperature ensures more even cooking when roasted. Cold meat straight from the refrigerator tends to cook unevenly, with the exterior possibly overcooking while the interior is not done yet.\n",

            "1. **Flavor Infusion:** The herbs impart their flavors to the squash, enhancing its natural sweetness and adding depth to the dish. Sage and rosemary (or thyme, if substituted) provide a hearty, earthy flavor that complements the richness of the squash.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Even Coating:** Tossing ensures that the herbs, spices, and butter are evenly distributed over all the squash pieces, which helps in cooking them uniformly and infusing the flavor throughout each piece.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Aromatic Release:** The heat from cooking helps release the essential oils in the herbs, which not only increases the aroma in the dish but also enhances the overall dining experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Texture:** The butter in the mixture helps to roast the squash to a perfect tender texture while achieving a slightly crisp exterior.\n",

        "        3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\n",

Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes.

Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage.

(If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\n",
