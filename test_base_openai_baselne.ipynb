Adding it later in the roasting process ensures it turns golden and crisp just right, rather than drying out or getting too hard.\\n\\n2. **Cooking Time Management**: Apples and bread pieces don’t require as much cooking time as acorn squash. By adding them later, you ensure that all components are perfectly cooked at the same time — the squash becomes tender just as the apples soften and the bread crisps up.\\n\\nIf you don't have a rimmed baking sheet available, you can use any large, oven-safe dish or pan with sides high enough to contain the ingredients and their juices.

Use about 15 milliliters of white wine vinegar diluted with 45 milliliters of water to substitute for the 60 milliliters of white wine. This will add a similar tangy profile without the alcohol.\\n\\n3. **Apple Cider Vinegar or Lemon Juice**: For a different but equally delicious tang, you could use apple cider vinegar or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice diluted with water. Like with white wine vinegar, use a smaller quantity of vinegar or lemon juice mixed with water.\\n\\n4. **Non-Alcoholic Wine**: If you want the flavor of wine without the alcohol, non-alcoholic wines are a great substitute and can be used in the same quantity as regular wine.\\n\\nEach of these substitutes offers a way to adapt the recipe based on your preferences and what you have available in your kitchen.\"},\n",

Begin by pulling a leg away from the body, and cut through the skin between the leg and the body. Bend the leg back until the thigh bone pops out of its socket; cut through the joint and skin to completely detach the leg. Repeat with the other leg.\\n\\n3. **Separate Drumsticks and Thighs**: Each leg consists of a thigh and a drumstick. Find the joint that connects these two parts by bending them until you feel the joint. Cut through this joint to separate them.\\n\\n4. **Remove the Breasts**: Make a deep cut along one side of the breastbone, and guide your knife along the rib cage to remove the breast from the bone. Try to keep as much meat intact as possible. Repeat this on the other side of the breastbone.\\n\\n5. **Wings**: Cut through the joint where the wings attach to the body if you prefer to serve them separately. \\n\\n6. **Slicing the Breast**: For a more elegant presentation, you can slice the breast meat into even slices. This not only looks appealing but also makes it easier to serve.\\n\\n7. **Arrange on the Platter**: Arrange the legs, thighs, wings, and sliced breast beautifully on your serving platter. You can fan out the breast slices and lay the legs and wings around them decoratively.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you’ll have a beautifully carved chicken that is ready for presentation and easy to serve. Remember to use a sharp chef’s knife for cleaner cuts, and take your time to follow the natural contours of the chicken.\"},\n",

Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes.

(If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\n",
