Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\n\n        2. Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½\"\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\n        3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\n\n        4. Add bread, apples, oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\n        Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\n\n        5. Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\n\n        6. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until  mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\n\n        7. Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\n\n        8. Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\n\n        9. Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.\n------------------------------\nPlease recall all the ingredients before continuing."

      "content": "Letting the seasoned chicken sit at room temperature for 1 hour before roasting has a few purposes:\n\n1. Even Cooking: By allowing the chicken to come to room temperature, you ensure that it cooks more evenly throughout. Starting with a chicken that isn't ice-cold from the fridge helps the heat penetrate more evenly during roasting.\n\n2. Improved Texture: Roasting a chicken that is closer to room temperature can result in a juicier and more tender final product. The chicken's muscle fibers relax slightly when it's not cold, leading to a more succulent texture.\n\n3. Enhanced Flavor: Allowing the salt to penetrate the chicken while it sits at room temperature enhances the flavor as the seasoning has more time to be absorbed into the meat.\n\n4. Crispy Skin: Starting with a chicken at room temperature can help the skin crisp up better during roasting, resulting in a more appealing texture.\n\nTaking this time to let the seasoned chicken rest before roasting can greatly improve the overall outcome of your dish.

Remove the skin using a vegetable peeler: Run a vegetable peeler along the ridges of the squash halves to remove the tough skin. Make sure to peel off all the skin to expose the flesh of the squash.\n\n3. Cut each half into ½-inch thick wedges: Once the skin is removed, slice each squash half into ½-inch thick wedges.

Preheat the oven: Place a rack in the middle and lower third of the oven and preheat it to 425°F (218°C). This ensures even cooking of the chicken.\n\n2. Mix miso and room-temperature butter: In a small bowl, combine the white miso and 3 tablespoons of room-temperature butter until they form a smooth mixture. This miso butter will add savory umami flavors to the chicken during roasting.\n\n3. Pat the chicken dry: Use paper towels to pat the chicken dry, which helps ensure a crispy skin when roasted and allows the miso butter to adhere well to the chicken.\n\n4. Rub or brush the chicken with miso butter: Coat the entire surface of the chicken with the miso butter mixture, either by rubbing it on or brushing it over the chicken. This step adds flavor and moisture to the chicken as it roasts.\n\n5. Roast the chicken in a cast-iron skillet: Place the chicken in a large cast-iron skillet on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Roast the chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155°F (68°C), which typically takes about 50-60 minutes. The internal temperature will continue to rise to 165°F (74°C) as the chicken rests.\n\n6.
