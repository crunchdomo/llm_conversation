Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\n\n        2. Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½\"\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\n        3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\n\n        4. Add bread, apples, oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\n        Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\n\n        5. Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\n\n        6. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until  mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\n\n        7. Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\n\n        8. Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\n\n        9. Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.\n------------------------------\nPlease recall all the ingredients before continuing."

Preheat the oven: Position racks in the middle and lower thirds of the oven and preheat it to 425°F (220°C). Preheating ensures the oven reaches the desired temperature for roasting the chicken evenly.\n\n2. Prepare the miso butter mixture: In a small bowl, combine the white miso paste and 3 tablespoons of room-temperature butter, mixing them until smooth. This miso butter mixture will infuse the chicken with savory and umami flavors during roasting.\n\n3. Prepare the chicken: Pat the chicken dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This step helps the skin crisp up nicely during roasting.\n\n4. Coat the chicken with miso butter: Rub or brush the miso butter mixture all over the chicken, covering it evenly with the flavorful mixture. This helps add richness and depth of flavor to the chicken as it roasts.\n\n5. Roast the chicken: Place the chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast it on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Cook the chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155°F (68°C). This typically takes around 50-60 minutes.\n\n6. Let the chicken rest: Once the chicken reaches the desired temperature, let it rest in the skillet for at least 5 minutes. Resting allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a juicier and more flavorful chicken.\n\n7. Transfer the chicken: After resting, transfer the chicken to a plate, reserving the skillet for later use in the recipe.\n\nOnce you've completed this step, ensure the chicken is cooked to the recommended temperature before proceeding with the next steps.

        "prompt": "You're following a recipe with 9 steps. Current step: 7.\nLast instruction: In this step, you will be creating a mixture of flour and butter to help thicken and enrich the gravy for the roast chicken. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:\n\n1. Mash flour and butter: In a small bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and room-temperature unsalted butter. Use your fingers to mash and mix the flour and butter together until they are well combined. This process creates a smooth paste-like mixture.\n\nThe flour and butter mixture, also known as a roux, acts as a thickening agent for the gravy. It helps create a smooth and consistent texture while adding richness to the dish.\n\nOnce you have combined the flour and butter, you will use this mixture to thicken the pan drippings and create a flavorful gravy to serve with the roast chicken.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this step or when you're ready to proceed by saying 'next'.\nAsk ONE SHORT, direct question to the chef about either ingredient substitutions or cooking technique for this step. For example: 'What can I use instead of kosher salt?' or 'Why do I need to tie the chicken legs together?' If no question is relevant, say 'next'.\n",

        "prompt": "You're following a recipe with 9 steps. Current step: 8.\nLast instruction: In this step, you will be creating a flavorful gravy to serve with the roast chicken by following these instructions:\n\n1. Heat the skillet: Set the skillet with the chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have approximately 1/4 cup of drippings in the skillet, but a slight variation is acceptable. If you have excess drippings, you can drain off the extra and set it aside for later use.\n\n2. Deglaze with wine: Add the dry white wine to the skillet and cook, stirring often. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. This process deglazes the pan, incorporating the flavorful browned bits into the gravy.\n\n3. Reduce the wine: Cook the wine until it is reduced by about half. This reduction process intensifies the flavors of the wine and allows it to blend seamlessly with the other ingredients in the gravy.\n\n4. Add the flour and butter mixture: Once the wine is reduced, add the flour and butter mixture to the skillet. Stir constantly to combine the roux with the pan drippings and wine, creating a smooth paste-like texture.\n\n5. Incorporate broth: Pour in the unsalted chicken broth and any remaining reserved drippings. Stir constantly to combine all the ingredients. As the mixture cooks, it will thicken to create a rich and savory gravy.\n\n6. Finish with miso: Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the white miso paste. The miso adds depth of flavor and a savory umami taste to the gravy.\n\n7. Season to taste: Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning as needed with salt and freshly ground black pepper. This step ensures that the flavors are well-balanced and enhanced.\n\nBy following these steps, you will create a delicious gravy to serve with the roast chicken, complementing the dish with added richness.
