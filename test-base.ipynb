      "2. **Seasoning:** Season the chicken all over with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. Remember to sprinkle some additional salt around the chicken's surface before tying the legs together.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tying Legs Together:** Tie the legs of the chicken together using kitchen twine. This helps hold the leg joints tight during roasting, ensuring even cooking throughout the bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Let Sit:** Allow the seasoned chicken to sit at room temperature for one hour. Room temperature ingredients help achieve better flavor development and browning during cooking.\n",

Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½\"\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\\n\\n        3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\\n\\n        4.

Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\\n\\n        6. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\\n\\n        7. Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\\n\\n        8. Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat.

Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes.

The goal here is to create a smooth sauce-like substance.\\n\\n2. **Cook the Sauce:** Heat the skillet over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup of liquid, but anything within a range of 1-2 tablespoons is acceptable. Cook the sauce, stirring frequently, until the mixture starts to form a smooth paste. Expect this process to take about 2-3 minutes.\\n\\n3. **Reduce the Sauce:** Gradually add the dry white wine to the sauce. Continue to whisk the sauce continuously, gradually reducing its volume. You want to reach a point where the sauce has thickened enough so you can smell the wine, usually taking about another minute.\\n\\n4. **Mix in Broth and Miso Paste:** Add the chicken and vegetable broth to the'},\n",
