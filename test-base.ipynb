      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's gather all the necessary ingredients to ensure we have everything ready before starting the cooking process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "- **Chicken:** 1 (3½–4-lb.) whole chicken\n",
      "- **Acorn Squash:** 2 small acorn squash (about 3 lb. total)\n",
      "- **Sage:** 2 Tbsp. finely chopped\n",
      "- **Rosemary:** 1 Tbsp. finely chopped\n",
      "- **Melted Butter:** 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus 3 Tbsp. room temperature\n",
      "- **Allspice:** ¼ tsp. ground allspice\n",
      "- **Red Pepper Flakes:** Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes\n",
      "- **Black Pepper:** Freshly ground black pepper\n",
      "- **White Bread:** ⅓ loaf good-quality sturdy white bread, torn into 1\" pieces (about 2½ cups)\n",
      "- **Apples:** 2 medium apples (such as Gala or Pink Lady; about 14 oz. total), cored, cut into 1\" pieces\n",
      "- **Extra-Virgin Olive Oil:** 2 Tbsp.\n",
      "- **Red Onion:** 1 small red onion, thinly sliced\n",
      "- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** 3 Tbsp.\n",
      "- **White Miso:** 2 Tbsp., mixed with 1/2 cup water\n",
      "- **Flour:** 2 Tbsp.\n",
      "- **Butter:** 3 Tbsp. room temperature\n",
      "- **Dry White Wine:** 2 Tbsp.\n",
      "- **Chicken Broth:** 2 cups\n",
      "- **White Miso:** 2 tsp.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Season the Chicken\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s prepare the chicken by patting it dry with paper towels, seasoning all over with 2 teaspoons of salt, and tying its legs together with kitchen twine. This helps in basting during roasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Preheat Oven\n",
      "\n",
      "Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C). Place the chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Prepare the Acorn Squash\n",
      "\n",
      "Halve the acorn squash and scoop out the seeds. You can peel them if desired, but keep the skin intact. Cut each half into slices that will fit snugly around the chicken\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Got it! Ready for step 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chef: Great! We're ready for step 1 now. Here's what comes next in our recipe:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine.**\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, take your seasoned chicken and gently pat it dry using paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Next, sprinkle 2 teaspoons of kosher salt evenly across the entire surface of the chicken. Finally, tie the chicken’s legs together with kitchen twine to create neat folds along both sides. This not only adds an attractive appearance to the bird but also helps in keeping the meat juices inside while cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trainee: Done with step 1. Continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chef: Alright! Moving forward from step 1 where we've prepared the chicken, let's proceed to the next crucial step:\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Halve squash and scoop out seeds...**\n",
      "\n",
      "Next up, halve the acorn squash. Once they’re halved, use a spoon to carefully scoop out the seeds from the center of each half. Be careful not to damage the flesh of the squash as much as possible. If you find some tough sections, feel free to discard those without affecting the taste too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "This step ensures that the squash has a smooth texture when roasted, which enhances the overall flavor of the dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "That concludes step 2. Keep following the recipe for the rest of the preparation stages!\n",
