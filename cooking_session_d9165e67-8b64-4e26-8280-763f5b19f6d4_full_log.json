Let me break down step 1 for you:\n\nFirst, patting the chicken dry with paper towels is important because removing excess moisture helps the skin become nice and crispy when you roast it.\n\nNext, seasoning the chicken all over with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt adds flavor and helps the meat retain moisture as it cooks.\n\nThen, tying the legs together with kitchen twine—this is called trussing—helps the chicken cook evenly, prevents the legs from splaying out, and gives the finished roast a tidy, compact shape.\n\nFinally, letting the chicken sit at room temperature for 1 hour before roasting allows it to come to an even temperature inside, which promotes more consistent cooking throughout.\n\nIf you want, I can guide you on how to tie the chicken legs using kitchen twine—just ask! Otherwise, whenever you're ready, just say \"next\" and we'll move on.",

Tying the chicken legs together—called trussing—helps the bird cook evenly by keeping the legs close to the body. When legs are tied, they don’t spread out and dry out or cook faster than the rest of the chicken. It also makes the chicken shape more compact, making it easier to handle and giving you a better presentation when serving.\n\nNow, about step 2: You’ll start preparing the acorn squash by halving it and scooping out the seeds. Acorn squash has ridges that make the skin a bit tricky to peel—running a vegetable peeler along those ridges first helps remove the tough outer layer. After peeling, you cut each half into ½-inch-thick wedges for even cooking. Placing them on a rimmed baking sheet is important because it catches any juices that might spill when roasting.\n\nIf you have any questions about peeling or cutting the squash, feel free to ask! Otherwise, just say \"next\" whenever you're ready to continue.",

The skin of acorn squash is edible and becomes tender enough to eat after roasting, though it can be a bit firmer or chewier than the flesh. Some people enjoy the texture and flavor the skin adds, while others prefer to peel it off for a softer bite. So, it really depends on your preference.\n\nNow, onto step 3: You’ll combine finely chopped sage, rosemary, and 6 tablespoons of melted butter in a large bowl—this herb butter mixture adds wonderful aroma and rich flavor to the squash.\n\nNext, pour half of this mixture over the squash wedges you've arranged on your baking sheet.\n\nThen, sprinkle the squash with ground allspice, a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for a subtle spicy kick, ½ teaspoon of salt for seasoning, and freshly ground black pepper.\n\nFinally, toss everything gently but thoroughly to make sure the squash wedges are evenly coated with the herb butter and spices. This coating will help the squash caramelize nicely as it roasts, resulting in tender, flavorful pieces.\n\nLet me know if you'd like tips on tossing or seasoning, or say \"next\" when you’re ready to move forward!",

A general guideline is to use about one-third the amount of dried herbs compared to fresh. So for 2 tablespoons of fresh sage, you’d use about 2 teaspoons of dried; for 1 tablespoon of fresh rosemary, use about 1 teaspoon dried. Also, dried herbs don't offer quite the same fresh brightness, but they still give great flavor.\n\nNow, for step 4: you’ll take the remaining herb butter mixture in your large bowl and add the torn bread pieces, apple chunks, 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Season with freshly ground black pepper, then toss everything together so the bread and apples are nicely coated in the buttery, herby oil. Setting this aside lets the flavors meld and preps the bread and apples for roasting.\n\nAt the same time, place your thinly sliced red onion and 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in a small bowl. Season with a pinch of salt and toss well to coat. This quick pickling softens the onion’s sharpness and adds acidity which will balance the richness of the dish. Let the onions sit, tossing occasionally, until you're ready to serve.\n\nIf you'd like advice on how to toss gently or any other details, just ask!

Lemon juice is also acidic and will soften the onions while adding brightness and a bit of citrusy flavor. Keep in mind, lemon juice has a more pronounced citrus taste and is less sweet and fruity compared to apple cider vinegar, so the flavor profile will be slightly different but still delicious.\n\nNow, onto step 5:\n\nFirst, set your oven racks so that one is in the middle position and another in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°F. This rack placement allows you to roast the chicken and the squash simultaneously later on, using different heat zones for best results.\n\nNext, mix 1 tablespoon of white miso with 3 tablespoons of room-temperature unsalted butter in a small bowl until you get a smooth, creamy miso butter. This flavorful butter mixture will add depth and umami to the chicken.\n\nBefore applying the miso butter, pat the chicken dry again with paper towels. This helps ensure the skin crisps up nicely as it roasts.\n\nThen, rub or brush the miso butter all over the chicken evenly—covering the skin and any exposed areas.\n\nPlace the chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and put it on the middle rack in your oven.\n\nRoast the chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155°F. This usually takes about 50 to 60 minutes. Note that the chicken's internal temperature will continue to rise to about 165°F during resting, which is the safe temperature for cooked poultry.\n\nAfter roasting, let the chicken rest in the skillet for at least 5 minutes. Resting allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring juicy and tender meat.\n\nFinally, transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve the cast-iron skillet with the drippings; you'll use it later to make the gravy.\n\nLet me know if you'd like tips on how to test doneness with a thermometer or how to handle resting the chicken, or say \"next\" when you're ready to continue!",

Moisture on the skin can cause the chicken to steam rather than roast, which prevents the skin from getting crispy and browned. A dry surface allows the miso butter to stick evenly, and helps the skin develop that delicious, golden crust with great texture and flavor as it cooks.\n\nNow, about step 6:\n\nAfter the chicken has started roasting, you'll roast the acorn squash wedges on the lower oven rack until they're mostly tender, which usually takes about 25 minutes.\n\nOnce the squash is ready, remove the baking sheet from the oven and evenly scatter the bread, apple, and herb butter mixture you prepared earlier over the squash. Spreading it as evenly as possible helps everything cook uniformly and allows the bread to toast nicely.\n\nReturn the baking sheet to the oven and continue roasting until the bread is golden brown and crisp, and the apples become tender. This usually takes about 15 minutes.\n\nAfter this, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Drain the pickled onions you prepared earlier to remove excess vinegar, then toss them into the warm squash, bread, and apple mixture. This will soften the onions slightly and merge their tangy flavor into the panzanella.\n\nFinally, transfer this delicious squash panzanella to a serving dish, ready to accompany your perfectly roasted chicken.\n\nFeel free to ask if you'd like tips on spreading the bread mixture or managing oven timing! Otherwise, just say \"next\" when you want to continue.",

You can substitute acorn squash with other types of squash like butternut, kabocha, or delicata squash. These alternatives have similar roasting qualities—they become tender and slightly sweet when cooked—but each has its own distinct flavor and texture. Butternut, for example, is smoother and sweeter, while kabocha is a bit denser and richer.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer, vegetables like sweet potatoes or carrots could work as well; they roast beautifully and add sweetness, but keep in mind this will alter the overall flavor and texture of your dish.\n\nNow, onto step 7:\n\nYou’ll use your fingers to mash together the ¼ cup of all-purpose flour and 2 tablespoons of room-temperature unsalted butter in a small bowl. This mixture is called a beurre manié — essentially a paste that acts as a thickening agent for the gravy you'll make later.\n\nUsing your fingers helps you evenly combine the flour and butter without forming lumps, producing a smooth paste that will incorporate easily into the sauce.\n\nWhen you’re ready, say “next,” or ask any questions you have about this step!",

      "content": "<recipe_analysis>\nUser asked if cold butter can be used instead of room temperature butter for beurre manié—a mixture to thicken sauce.\n\nKey points:\n- Room temperature butter is preferred because it combines more easily with flour.\n- Cold butter tends to clump or be hard to incorporate evenly.\n- May affect smoothness and effectiveness of thickening in final sauce.\n\nStep 8 involves:\n- Using reserved skillet with chicken drippings to build pan sauce.\n- Adding white wine and reducing it to concentrate flavor.\n- Incorporating beurre manié (flour-butter paste) to thicken.\n- Adding chicken broth and drippings, cooking to thicken sauce.\n- Stirring in miso for umami, adjusting seasoning.\n\nPlan:\n- First, answer question about cold vs room temp butter for beurre manié.\n- Then explain step 8 clearly, emphasizing technique of deglazing, stirring, reducing, thickening, seasoning.\n- Invite questions or \"next.\"\n\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Using room temperature butter for making beurre manié is best because it allows the butter and flour to combine smoothly and evenly. Cold butter is harder to mash with the flour; it may clump and not form a consistent paste, which can lead to lumps when you add it to the sauce. Room temperature butter ensures the beurre manié will blend nicely into the pan juices to create a smooth, thickened gravy.\n\nNow, for step 8:\n\nPlace the cast-iron skillet with the reserved chicken drippings over medium heat on your stove. Aim to have about ¼ cup of drippings—slightly more or less is fine. If you have significantly more, drain the excess and set it aside to add back if needed.\n\nAdd ¼ cup of dry white wine to the skillet. Stir frequently and use a wooden spoon to gently scrape up any browned bits stuck to the pan—that's where a lot of flavor lives. Cook and reduce the wine by about half; you’ll know it's ready when you can smell the wine aroma clearly, which usually takes around 2 minutes.\n\nNext, add the butter-flour mixture (your beurre manié) to the skillet. Keep stirring often; about 2 minutes later, you’ll see a smooth paste forming, which is the base of your sauce.\n\nThen, gradually add 2 cups of unsalted chicken broth along with any reserved drippings. Stir constantly as the sauce simmers and thickens, which takes about 6 to 8 minutes.\n\nFinally, remove the skillet from the heat and stir in 2 teaspoons of white miso to add rich umami flavor. Taste your sauce and adjust seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.\n\nIf you'd like tips on reducing wine or achieving the right sauce consistency, just ask!

Chicken stock is typically made by simmering bones and connective tissue for a longer time, which extracts collagen and gives the stock a fuller body and deeper taste compared to broth. This will add extra silkiness and depth to your miso gravy.\n\nNow, for step 9, the final step:\n\nYou’ll serve your beautifully roasted miso-butter chicken alongside the squash panzanella you prepared, and generously spoon the warm miso gravy over the chicken or on the side.\n\nFor best results, carve the chicken into portions—breast, thighs, legs—and arrange them neatly on plates or a serving platter.\n\nPlace a generous helping of the squash panzanella on the side as a flavorful, colorful accompaniment.\n\nAdd a few spoonfuls of the rich miso gravy over the chicken or serve it on the side for dipping.\n\nThis presentation brings together all the components—the juicy, umami-rich chicken, sweet and savory squash panzanella, and velvety gravy—into a balanced, satisfying meal.\n\nCongratulations on making this delicious dish!

Resting the chicken for at least 5 minutes allows the juices, which are drawn to the center during cooking, to redistribute throughout the meat. If you carve it too soon, those flavorful juices will run out onto the cutting board, leaving the meat drier and less tender.\n\nBy resting first, you ensure every bite is juicy and delicious!\n\nCongratulations on completing your Miso-Butter Roast Chicken with Acorn Squash Panzanella!

Let me break down step 1 for you:\n\nFirst, patting the chicken dry with paper towels is important because removing excess moisture helps the skin become nice and crispy when you roast it.\n\nNext, seasoning the chicken all over with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt adds flavor and helps the meat retain moisture as it cooks.\n\nThen, tying the legs together with kitchen twine—this is called trussing—helps the chicken cook evenly, prevents the legs from splaying out, and gives the finished roast a tidy, compact shape.\n\nFinally, letting the chicken sit at room temperature for 1 hour before roasting allows it to come to an even temperature inside, which promotes more consistent cooking throughout.\n\nIf you want, I can guide you on how to tie the chicken legs using kitchen twine—just ask! Otherwise, whenever you're ready, just say \"next\" and we'll move on.\nAsk ONE SHORT, direct question to the chef about either ingredient substitutions or cooking technique for this step. For example: 'What can I use instead of kosher salt?' or 'Why do I need to tie the chicken legs together?' If no question is relevant, say 'next'.\n",

Current step: 2.\nLast instruction: <recipe_analysis>\nUser has asked a question about tying chicken legs and also wants an explanation of step 2 regarding preparing acorn squash.\n\nKey points for tying legs:\n- Ensures even cooking\n- Keeps the bird compact for easier handling\n- Prevents legs from drying out or overcooking\n\nFor step 2:\n- Halving and seeding squash is standard preparation\n- Peeling acorn squash can be tough because of ridges; peeling ridges first is easier\n- Cutting into uniform ½\" wedges helps even roasting\n- Using a rimmed baking sheet prevents juices from spilling during roasting\n\nPlan:\n- First answer question about tying legs thoroughly\n- Then explain step 2 clearly with tips on peeling and cutting squash\n- Confirm readiness before moving ahead\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Great question! Tying the chicken legs together—called trussing—helps the bird cook evenly by keeping the legs close to the body. When legs are tied, they don’t spread out and dry out or cook faster than the rest of the chicken. It also makes the chicken shape more compact, making it easier to handle and giving you a better presentation when serving.\n\nNow, about step 2: You’ll start preparing the acorn squash by halving it and scooping out the seeds. Acorn squash has ridges that make the skin a bit tricky to peel—running a vegetable peeler along those ridges first helps remove the tough outer layer. After peeling, you cut each half into ½-inch-thick wedges for even cooking. Placing them on a rimmed baking sheet is important because it catches any juices that might spill when roasting.\n\nIf you have any questions about peeling or cutting the squash, feel free to ask! Otherwise, just say \"next\" whenever you're ready to continue.\nAsk ONE SHORT, direct question to the chef about either ingredient substitutions or cooking technique for this step. For example: 'What can I use instead of kosher salt?' or 'Why do I need to tie the chicken legs together?' If no question is relevant, say 'next'.\n",

Current step: 3.\nLast instruction: <recipe_analysis>\nUser asked if acorn squash can be roasted unpeeled; user also jumped to step 3 for explanation.\n\nKey points:\n- Acorn squash skin is edible but can be tough; roasting unpeeled is possible and depends on texture preference.\n- Step 3 involves making herb butter mix with sage, rosemary, butter.\n- Half of the mixture is poured over squash; spices and salt added; squash tossed to coat well for flavor and even roasting.\n- Explain benefits of herb butter coating and seasoning.\n\nPlan:\n- First answer about roasting squash unpeeled: mention skin is edible but consider personal texture preference.\n- Then break down step 3 clearly, emphasize seasoning and tossing, suggest tips for even coating and flavor.\n- Wait for next or questions.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: You absolutely can roast the acorn squash wedges without peeling them first! The skin of acorn squash is edible and becomes tender enough to eat after roasting, though it can be a bit firmer or chewier than the flesh. Some people enjoy the texture and flavor the skin adds, while others prefer to peel it off for a softer bite. So, it really depends on your preference.\n\nNow, onto step 3: You’ll combine finely chopped sage, rosemary, and 6 tablespoons of melted butter in a large bowl—this herb butter mixture adds wonderful aroma and rich flavor to the squash.\n\nNext, pour half of this mixture over the squash wedges you've arranged on your baking sheet.\n\nThen, sprinkle the squash with ground allspice, a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for a subtle spicy kick, ½ teaspoon of salt for seasoning, and freshly ground black pepper.\n\nFinally, toss everything gently but thoroughly to make sure the squash wedges are evenly coated with the herb butter and spices. This coating will help the squash caramelize nicely as it roasts, resulting in tender, flavorful pieces.\n\nLet me know if you'd like tips on tossing or seasoning, or say \"next\" when you’re ready to move forward!\nAsk ONE SHORT, direct question to the chef about either ingredient substitutions or cooking technique for this step.

Current step: 4.\nLast instruction: <recipe_analysis>\nUser asked about substituting fresh herbs with dried in the herb butter mix, then wants explanation of step 4.\n\nKey points:\n- Fresh vs dried herbs differ in potency (dried are more concentrated).\n- Substitution ratio and flavor impact.\n- Step 4 involves taking remaining herb butter, adding bread, apples, oil, salt, black pepper; tossing for coating.\n- Also pickling onions briefly in vinegar with salt, allowing flavors to mellow before serving.\n- The step prepares components for acorn squash panzanella.\n\nPlan:\n- Answer fresh vs dried herbs question with substitution guidance.\n- Then explain step 4 clearly about making bread-apple mixture and quick pickled onions.\n- Emphasize tossing to coat and letting onions marinate.\n- Wait for next or questions.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Great questions!\n\nFirst, about substituting fresh herbs with dried in the herb butter mix: you can absolutely do that, but keep in mind that dried herbs are more concentrated in flavor than fresh. A general guideline is to use about one-third the amount of dried herbs compared to fresh. So for 2 tablespoons of fresh sage, you’d use about 2 teaspoons of dried; for 1 tablespoon of fresh rosemary, use about 1 teaspoon dried. Also, dried herbs don't offer quite the same fresh brightness, but they still give great flavor.\n\nNow, for step 4: you’ll take the remaining herb butter mixture in your large bowl and add the torn bread pieces, apple chunks, 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Season with freshly ground black pepper, then toss everything together so the bread and apples are nicely coated in the buttery, herby oil. Setting this aside lets the flavors meld and preps the bread and apples for roasting.\n\nAt the same time, place your thinly sliced red onion and 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in a small bowl. Season with a pinch of salt and toss well to coat. This quick pickling softens the onion’s sharpness and adds acidity which will balance the richness of the dish. Let the onions sit, tossing occasionally, until you're ready to serve.\n\nIf you'd like advice on how to toss gently or any other details, just ask!

Current step: 5.\nLast instruction: <recipe_analysis>\nUser asked if lemon juice is suitable to substitute apple cider vinegar for pickling onions, then jumped ahead to Step 5 asking for explanation of roasting chicken with miso butter.\n\nKey points on vinegar substitution:\n- Lemon juice can be used instead of apple cider vinegar; it's acidic and will impart similar brightness but slightly different flavor.\n- Lemon juice is more citrusy and less sweet than apple cider vinegar.\n- Both help soften onions and add acidity to balance richness.\n\nStep 5 involves:\n- Oven setup: placing racks in middle and lower third, preheating to 425°F.\n- Mixing miso paste with room-temperature butter to make a smooth miso butter.\n- Patting chicken dry again to ensure dry skin for crispness.\n- Rubbing miso butter evenly all over the chicken for flavor and browning.\n- Roasting chicken on middle rack for about 50-60 minutes until internal temp 155°F.\n- Resting chicken for 5 minutes to redistribute juices, letting temp rise to 165°F.\n- Transferring chicken to plate and reserving skillet for sauce later.\n\nPlan:\n- First confirm lemon juice substitution, give pros/cons carefully.\n- Then explain step 5 thoroughly with tips on oven rack placement, importance of thermometer, resting, and use of cast iron skillet.\n- Wait for questions or \"next\" signal.\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Great questions!\n\nYes, you can use lemon juice in place of apple cider vinegar to pickle the onions. Lemon juice is also acidic and will soften the onions while adding brightness and a bit of citrusy flavor. Keep in mind, lemon juice has a more pronounced citrus taste and is less sweet and fruity compared to apple cider vinegar, so the flavor profile will be slightly different but still delicious.\n\nNow, onto step 5:\n\nFirst, set your oven racks so that one is in the middle position and another in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°F. This rack placement allows you to roast the chicken and the squash simultaneously later on, using different heat zones for best results.\n\nNext, mix 1 tablespoon of white miso with 3 tablespoons of room-temperature unsalted butter in a small bowl until you get a smooth, creamy miso butter. This flavorful butter mixture will add depth and umami to the chicken.\n\nBefore applying the miso butter, pat the chicken dry again with paper towels. This helps ensure the skin crisps up nicely as it roasts.\n\nThen, rub or brush the miso butter all over the chicken evenly—covering the skin and any exposed areas.\n\nPlace the chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and put it on the middle rack in your oven.\n\nRoast the chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 155°F. This usually takes about 50 to 60 minutes. Note that the chicken's internal temperature will continue to rise to about 165°F during resting, which is the safe temperature for cooked poultry.\n\nAfter roasting, let the chicken rest in the skillet for at least 5 minutes. Resting allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring juicy and tender meat.\n\nFinally, transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve the cast-iron skillet with the drippings; you'll use it later to make the gravy.\n\nLet me know if you'd like tips on how to test doneness with a thermometer or how to handle resting the chicken, or say \"next\" when you're ready to continue!\nAsk ONE SHORT, direct question to the chef about either ingredient substitutions or cooking technique for this step.

Current step: 6.\nLast instruction: <recipe_analysis>\nUser asked why patting chicken dry before applying miso butter is important, then requested explanation for step 6.\n\nKey points for patting chicken dry:\n- Removes surface moisture so skin can crisp properly\n- Prevents steaming instead of roasting\n- Helps miso butter adhere better for even browning\n\nStep 6 details:\n- Roasting squash on lower rack for about 25 minutes to become mostly tender\n- Then spreading bread-apple-butter mixture evenly over squash, roasting further until bread is golden and crisp, apples tender\n- Draining pickled onions and tossing into warm panzanella mixture before serving\n- Transferring final panzanella to serving dish\n\nPlan:\n- Explain patting chicken dry focusing on crisp skin and flavor absorption\n- Explain step 6 with tips for even spreading, timing, and tossing pickled onions to make flavorful panzanella\n- Encourage user to ask questions or say \"next\"\n</recipe_analysis>\n\nChefAI: Patting the chicken dry before applying the miso butter is very important because it removes excess surface moisture. Moisture on the skin can cause the chicken to steam rather than roast, which prevents the skin from getting crispy and browned. A dry surface allows the miso butter to stick evenly, and helps the skin develop that delicious, golden crust with great texture and flavor as it cooks.\n\nNow, about step 6:\n\nAfter the chicken has started roasting, you'll roast the acorn squash wedges on the lower oven rack until they're mostly tender, which usually takes about 25 minutes.\n\nOnce the squash is ready, remove the baking sheet from the oven and evenly scatter the bread, apple, and herb butter mixture you prepared earlier over the squash. Spreading it as evenly as possible helps everything cook uniformly and allows the bread to toast nicely.\n\nReturn the baking sheet to the oven and continue roasting until the bread is golden brown and crisp, and the apples become tender. This usually takes about 15 minutes.\n\nAfter this, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Drain the pickled onions you prepared earlier to remove excess vinegar, then toss them into the warm squash, bread, and apple mixture. This will soften the onions slightly and merge their tangy flavor into the panzanella.\n\nFinally, transfer this delicious squash panzanella to a serving dish, ready to accompany your perfectly roasted chicken.\n\nFeel free to ask if you'd like tips on spreading the bread mixture or managing oven timing!

You can substitute acorn squash with other types of squash like butternut, kabocha, or delicata squash. These alternatives have similar roasting qualities—they become tender and slightly sweet when cooked—but each has its own distinct flavor and texture. Butternut, for example, is smoother and sweeter, while kabocha is a bit denser and richer.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer, vegetables like sweet potatoes or carrots could work as well; they roast beautifully and add sweetness, but keep in mind this will alter the overall flavor and texture of your dish.\n\nNow, onto step 7:\n\nYou’ll use your fingers to mash together the ¼ cup of all-purpose flour and 2 tablespoons of room-temperature unsalted butter in a small bowl.

Cold butter is harder to mash with the flour; it may clump and not form a consistent paste, which can lead to lumps when you add it to the sauce. Room temperature butter ensures the beurre manié will blend nicely into the pan juices to create a smooth, thickened gravy.\n\nNow, for step 8:\n\nPlace the cast-iron skillet with the reserved chicken drippings over medium heat on your stove. Aim to have about ¼ cup of drippings—slightly more or less is fine. If you have significantly more, drain the excess and set it aside to add back if needed.\n\nAdd ¼ cup of dry white wine to the skillet. Stir frequently and use a wooden spoon to gently scrape up any browned bits stuck to the pan—that's where a lot of flavor lives. Cook and reduce the wine by about half; you’ll know it's ready when you can smell the wine aroma clearly, which usually takes around 2 minutes.\n\nNext, add the butter-flour mixture (your beurre manié) to the skillet. Keep stirring often; about 2 minutes later, you’ll see a smooth paste forming, which is the base of your sauce.\n\nThen, gradually add 2 cups of unsalted chicken broth along with any reserved drippings. Stir constantly as the sauce simmers and thickens, which takes about 6 to 8 minutes.\n\nFinally, remove the skillet from the heat and stir in 2 teaspoons of white miso to add rich umami flavor.
