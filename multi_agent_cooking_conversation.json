Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.\n\n        2. Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½\"\"-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\n        3. Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.\n\n        4. Add bread, apples, oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\n        Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.\n\n        5. Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.\n\n        6. Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until  mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.\n\n        7. Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.\n\n        8. Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.\n\n        9. Serve chicken with gravy and squash panzanella alongside.\n------------------------------\nPlease recall all the ingredients before continuing."

Pat the chicken dry with paper towels: This helps to remove any excess moisture on the chicken's surface, which will help achieve a crispy skin when roasting.\n\n2. Season all over with 2 tsp. salt: Sprinkle the kosher salt evenly all over the chicken, ensuring that it is seasoned both on the outside and inside. This step adds flavor to the chicken.\n\n3. Tie legs together with kitchen twine: This step helps the chicken cook more evenly by keeping the legs close to the body. Simply cross the legs and tie them together with kitchen twine.\n\n4. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour: Allowing the seasoned chicken to sit at room temperature for an hour helps it cook more evenly and ensures that it cooks through properly.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to move on to the next step by saying 'next'."

Remove the skin with a vegetable peeler: Use a vegetable peeler to carefully peel off the skin from the ridges of the squash halves. This step helps to remove the tough outer skin, making the squash more tender after roasting.\n\n3. Cut each half into ½\"-thick wedges: Once the squash halves are peeled, slice them into wedges that are about ½ inch thick. This size ensures even cooking and a nice texture.\n\n4. Arrange the squash wedges on a rimmed baking sheet: Place the squash wedges in a single layer on a baking sheet with raised edges to prevent any juices from spilling out during roasting.\n\nAfter you have completed these steps, please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to move on to the next step by saying 'next'."

Preheat the oven to 425°F: Make sure to position the oven racks in the middle and lower thirds of the oven to ensure even cooking. Preheating the oven allows it to reach the desired temperature for roasting.\n\n2. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter: In a small bowl, combine the white miso paste with 3 tablespoons of room-temperature butter. Mix them together until you achieve a smooth and uniform miso butter mixture.\n\n3. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels: Use paper towels to pat the seasoned chicken dry. This step helps to remove any excess moisture on the chicken's surface, allowing it to roast more evenly and develop a crispy skin.\n\n4. Rub or brush the chicken all over with miso butter: Use the prepared miso butter mixture to coat the chicken thoroughly. Make sure to rub or brush the miso butter both on the outside and inside of the chicken to infuse it with rich flavors.\n\n5. Place the chicken in a large cast-iron skillet: Transfer the miso-butter-coated chicken to a large cast-iron skillet, which is ideal for roasting and retains heat well during the cooking process.\n\n6. Roast the chicken until the internal temperature reaches 155°F: Roast the chicken in the preheated oven on the middle rack. Use an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature, and once it reaches 155°F in the thickest part of the breast, the chicken is ready. The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken, bringing it to a safe internal temperature of 165°F while resting.\n\n7. Let the chicken rest in the skillet for at least 5 minutes: Allowing the chicken to rest after roasting helps the juices redistribute, resulting in a moist and flavorful final dish.\n\n8. Transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve the skillet: Once the chicken has rested, transfer it to a serving plate. Keep the skillet with the drippings for the next steps in preparing the dish.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps or if you have any questions, please let me know by saying 'next'."

This initial roasting step helps to soften the squash and develop its flavors.\n\n2. Remove the squash from the oven and scatter the reserved bread mixture over the squash: Once the squash is mostly tender, take it out of the oven.

Set the reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat: Place the skillet containing the drippings from roasting the chicken over medium heat on the stovetop. The drippings will add richness and depth of flavor to the gravy.\n\n2. Add wine and cook, stirring often: Pour the wine into the skillet with the chicken drippings. Stir the mixture frequently and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. This process helps to incorporate the flavors and juices from the roasting process into the gravy.\n\n3. Reduce the wine by about half: Cook the wine with the chicken drippings until it reduces by about half. This step allows the alcohol to cook off and intensifies the flavors in the gravy.\n\n4. Add the butter mixture and cook until a smooth paste forms: Once the wine is reduced, add the flour and butter paste that you prepared earlier. Stir the mixture regularly until a smooth paste-like consistency forms. This paste will help thicken the gravy.\n\n5. Add the broth and any reserved drippings: Pour the unsalted chicken broth into the skillet, along with any remaining reserved drippings from the roasting process.

This process typically takes about 6-8 minutes.\n\n7. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the miso: Once the gravy has thickened, remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the white miso paste, which adds a savory umami flavor to the gravy.\n\n8.
