Here's a detailed explanation of this step:\n\n1. Roast the squash: After the initial roasting, continue cooking the squash on the lower oven rack until it is mostly tender, which typically takes about 25 minutes. This extended roasting time allows the squash to develop a soft texture and intensifies its natural sweetness.\n\n2. Add the bread mixture: Once the squash is mostly tender, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Scatter the reserved bread, apple, and herb mixture over the partially cooked squash, spreading it into an even layer. The bread will soak up the flavorful juices from the squash and apples during the final roasting stage.\n\n3. Roast until golden brown and crisp: Return the baking sheet to the oven and continue roasting until the bread is golden brown and crispy, and the apples are tender, which usually takes about 15 minutes. This final roasting step brings all the components together and creates a deliciously crunchy and flavorful panzanella dish.\n\n4. Combine with pickled onions: After removing the panzanella from the oven, drain the pickled onions and toss them with the roasted squash and bread mixture to incorporate all the flavors. This step adds a tangy contrast to the sweet and savory elements of the dish.\n\n5.

Here's a detailed explanation of this step:\n\n1. Heat the skillet with chicken drippings: Place the reserved skillet containing the chicken drippings over medium heat on the stovetop. The drippings are full of savory flavors that will enhance the gravy.\n\n2. Add wine and deglaze the pan: Pour in the white wine and stir, scraping up any browned bits (fond) from the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. This process, known as deglazing, incorporates the flavorful bits into the gravy, adding richness and depth to the sauce.\n\n3. Reduce the wine: Cook the wine for about 2 minutes, stirring often, until it is reduced by half. The reduction process intensifies the wine flavor while allowing alcohol to evaporate.\n\n4. Incorporate the butter mixture: Add the flour and butter mixture (smooth paste) to the skillet and cook, stirring often. This mixture acts as a thickening agent for the gravy and helps create a smooth consistency.\n\n5. Add broth and reserved drippings: Pour the unsalted chicken broth into the skillet, along with any additional reserved drippings from the roast chicken. Stir constantly to combine the ingredients thoroughly.\n\n6. Thicken the gravy: Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens to your desired consistency. This usually takes about 6-8 minutes. The gravy should coat the back of a spoon and have a silky texture.\n\n7. Stir in miso and season: Once the gravy is thickened, remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the white miso paste. Taste the gravy and season with salt and black pepper as needed to adjust the seasoning.\n\nCompleting this step will result in a rich and flavorful gravy to serve with the roast chicken. Feel free to ask any questions or say 'next' when you're ready to continue with the final step of the recipe.\nAsk ONE SHORT, direct question to the chef about either ingredient substitutions or cooking technique for this step. For example: 'What can I use instead of kosher salt?' or 'Why do I need to tie the chicken legs together?' If no question is relevant, say 'next'.\n"
